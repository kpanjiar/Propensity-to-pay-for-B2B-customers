# Propensity-to-pay-for-B2B-customers
Problem Description: Whether or not customers pay their debts on time to a company is crucial to its financial well being. With the strength of companies being tied closely to their capital, the ability to foresee cash flows from accounts receivable would be an invaluable tool for suggesting proactive policy decisions. The problem is to identify what factors influence customer propensity to pay and how long it takes defaulters to settle.

Objective: Given the accounts receivable data of invoices, the goal is to develop a dynamic classification model using machine learning to predict whether a customer will default and in what timeframe. The timeframe element allows for additional customer segmentation based on whether they will default for 0-30, 30-60, or 60+ days.
